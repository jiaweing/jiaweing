<p align="left"> 
A highly motivated individual who loves to write code, with extensive experience in software development. I am a software engineer with 8 years of self-taught knowledge of programming.
  
Ever since writing my first game scripts and seeing the lines of code turned into my desired output, I find it fascinating how real-world problems can be improved, solved, and automated just by typing on your keyboard. That was when I found my passion for software development at 13. I believe programming has the power to change and improve lives for people all around the world.

I still find myself amazed by the birth of taxi apps. I remember when we used to live in a world where taxis could only be reserved by calling a dedicated center if there weren't any nearby. This was a small matter that nobody would have ever thought of automating back then, it was simply genius! This move had brought great convenience to our society, completely changing the way we live today.

In my first internship, I was given the opportunity to develop foolproof blockchain-based systems that have prevented fraud and document tampering. I was also given a chance to develop smart contracts that tokenized digital assets into non-fungible tokens. This internship then turned into a full-time offer. It was an affirmation that software engineering was my dream.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, and organizing code. I've got PHP, C#, Python, Swift, Solidity, and Java in my grasp. I have used MySQL and MongoDB. I am familiar with development in .NET Core, Xamarin Forms, MVVC frameworks. I am currently picking up TypeScript programming with NodeJS.

There's certainly more to learn, more areas to grow in and more to build!
