## Hello World <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px"> [![StackShare](http://img.shields.io/badge/tech-stack-0690fa.svg?style=flat)](https://stackshare.io/my3t/my-stack)
<p align="left"> 
With vast experience in software development, a highly driven individual who enjoys writing code. I am a software engineer with eight years of self-taught programming experience.

I've always found it intriguing how real-world problems can be improved, addressed, and automated simply by typing on a keyboard, ever since I wrote my first video game scripts and saw the lines of code transform into my desired output. At the age of 13, I found my passion for software development. I feel that programming has the potential to influence and enhance people's lives all throughout the world.

The emergence of taxi applications continues to astound me. I remember a time when taxis could only be reserved by dialing a specialized center if there were none available nearby. This was a trivial point that no one would have pondered automating at the time; it was just brilliant! This decision had greatly benefited our society, dramatically altering the way we live today.

During my first internship, I had the opportunity to create foolproof blockchain-based systems that prevented document manipulation and fraud. I also had the opportunity to create smart contracts that tokenized digital assets and turned them into non-fungible tokens. After that, the internship blossomed into a full-time job offer. It was affirmation that software engineering was what I wanted to do in life.

My specialties include quickly learning new skills and programming languages, problem-solving, and organizing code. I've got PHP, C#, Python, Swift, Solidity, and Java in my grasp. I've worked with MySQL and MongoDB. I am familiar with development in .NET Core, Xamarin Forms, MVVC frameworks. I am currently learning TypeScript programming with NodeJS.

There's certainly more to learn, more areas to improve and more to build!
