<p align="left"> 
A highly driven individual who enjoys writing code, with vast experience in software development.

As a software engineer with eight years of self-taught programming experience, I have a strong passion for using code to improve and automate real-world problems. My fascination with software development began at the age of 13 when I wrote my first video game scripts and saw the lines of code transform into my desired output. I believe that programming has the power to positively impact people's lives on a global scale.

I have gained valuable experience through internships, including my first internship where I developed foolproof blockchain-based systems that prevented document manipulation and fraud, as well as smart contracts that tokenized digital assets and turned them into non-fungible tokens. This successful internship led to a full-time job offer, confirming my career path in software engineering.

I have a strong track record of success in the world of IT, demonstrated by my work on my own venture. Titan.tf is a global community of specialized and sophisticated Team Fortress 2 servers hosted around the world. Since its inception in 2015, I have served as the sole maintainer and developer for this community project.

As a result of my efforts, I have attracted over 420k unique players and reached an all-time peak of 300 concurrent players across all servers. In my role, I manage the front and back end of day-to-day operations and develop and implement new content and feature updates. This project has been a passion project of mine, and my continued involvement with it is a testament to my dedication to the field of IT and my desire to continue learning and exploring new opportunities.
